# WebGL Shading Demo
A low-level 3D rendering experiment built using raw WebGL — without libraries like Three.js. This project demonstrates real-time lighting, custom shader logic, and interactive visuals entirely through the WebGL API. All lighting calculations and visual effects are handled through manually written GLSL vertex and fragment shaders, offering fine-grained control over how objects are rendered and illuminated. <br /><br />
